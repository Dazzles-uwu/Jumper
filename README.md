# Jumper

Hints and suggestions
* Remember to modularize your assignment. Coding without breaking down the ‘how’ will get you nowhere very quickly. If unsure how to modularize, discuss this with your teaching staff
* Get your program working for a single action first and then add other actions once your code is working for the single action.
* Save the finding items for the end. It might prove a bit of a challenge so get the rest of your assignment working without it and then include it in later.
* Remember when testing your programs, to display probabilities on the screen to make the gameplay more understandable.
